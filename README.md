# APS105-Lab9-Music-Library

This repo contains my codes for the lab 9 of the APS 105 course project (Winter 2022), a personal music library.

APS 105 was an introductory C programming course at University of Toronto (ECE).

These codes were uploaded after the APS 105 Winter 2022 class was finished.
